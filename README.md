This is my simple developer resume for the web as initiated by create-next-app. Was also my first use case for lifting state in React, routing, and Single-Page App local vs. server-side rendering. At this time of writing it is also deployed by Vercel at https://kdlgates.com

On a system with Node.js installed:

> npm run start

Then open http://localhost:3000 with your browser.
